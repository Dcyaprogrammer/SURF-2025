# SURF-2025
Unsupervised Exploration

# Classic Control 
1. Run the whole script until you see title "Integrated", that's where the exploration and offline training begins
2. You can follow the interactive structure for parameter tuning in IQL which is not fully customizable now 
3. The notebook should demonstrate the expected output already for you to follow, remember to operate on your own copy 
4. Use wandb to monitor

code flow: preparation -> Exploration(parameter tuning)(out & few graphs) -> IQL(parameter tuning)(monitored by wandb)
