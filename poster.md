# Abstract

# Introduction

# Preliminaries(What is RL?)
1. a photo to demonstrate interaction loop
2. reward-free exploration
3. mutual information 

# Task 
1. Explore the env as much as we can 
2. Provide dataset for offline algorithm to reach the target state 
(maybe a structured graph here)

# Methods and Experiments
1. exploration
2. offline training 

# Conclusion and Future works 

# env
frozenlake pointax classic control(1)
